## 🎬 What is This?

**Gospel Snow Town** is a real-time AI survival simulation game. You don't play *as* the characters — you **watch them live, think, argue, cooperate, and die**.

Eight strangers are trapped in a frozen village as temperatures plunge from -10°C to -60°C over 4 days. Each NPC is powered by an LLM (Large Language Model) that drives their thoughts, conversations, and survival decisions in real-time. There is no script. Every playthrough tells a different story.

> *Think "The Long Dark" meets "Dwarf Fortress" meets "Stanford Generative Agents" — but in a browser.*

### 🎯 The Core Loop

```
Day 1 (-10°C): Discover the crisis. Gather supplies. Build trust.
Day 2 (-25°C): Temperature drops. Conflicts emerge. Resources run low.
Day 3 (0°C, The Calm): A brief respite. Race to prepare for tomorrow.
Day 4 (-60°C, Blizzard): The final test. Not everyone will survive.
```

If everyone dies — the world **reincarnates**. NPCs carry faint memories from past lives, making different choices each cycle. The question isn't *if* they survive, but *who* survives and *what they become*.

## ✨ Features

### 🧠 LLM-Powered Autonomous NPCs
- Each of the 8 NPCs has a unique personality, backstory, skills, and family relationships
- NPCs **think independently** using LLM — analyzing threats, opportunities, and social dynamics
- Conversations emerge naturally between NPCs based on context, mood, and urgency
- NPCs remember past interactions and form opinions about each other

### ❄️ Hardcore Survival Systems
- **Body Temperature** — Exposure below -25°C causes hypothermia → health drain → death
- **Hunger** — 4 hours of starvation triggers accelerated health loss (death in ~11 minutes)
- **Health → Death Chain** — Multiple conditions stack: starving + freezing + exhausted = rapid death
- **Dying State** — When health drops critically, NPCs collapse and call for help (5-min rescue window)
- **Resource Balance** — Wood, food, power, materials — all must be carefully managed against consumption

### 🔥 Meaningful Task System
- **Furnace Construction** — Building a second furnace requires real NPC labor, materials, and time
- **Radio Repair** — Progressive repair tracked 0%→100%, unlocks rescue on Day 4
- **Medicine Crafting** — First aid kits heal injured NPCs (+20 health)
- **Trap Setting** — Activates night warning system, boosts group morale
- **No Fake Tasks** — Every task produces verifiable, tangible game effects

### 🔄 Reincarnation System
- When all NPCs die, the world resets but carries forward
- Each cycle increments the "era number" 
- NPCs retain faint echoes from past lives, influencing future decisions
- Different choices emerge organically across reincarnation cycles

### 🎨 Pixel Art Aesthetic
- Procedurally generated maps (village + 9 indoor scenes)
- Dynamic weather system with snow particles and temperature visualization
- Frostbite-dark theme with survival-horror atmosphere
- Y-sorted rendering with layered bubble system

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Local Server (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/AI_Game_Gospel_snow_town.git
cd AI_Game_Gospel_snow_town

# Start the server
node server.js

# Open in browser
# http://localhost:8080
```

### Option 2: Direct Open

```bash
# Just open index.html in your browser (some LLM features may require a server)
open index.html
```

### LLM Configuration

The game supports two LLM backends:

| Mode | API | Best For |
|------|-----|----------|
| **Ollama Local** (Recommended) | `localhost:11434/api/chat` | Qwen3-14B-Q8 locally |
| **Cloud API** | OpenAI-compatible endpoint | GLM-4-Flash (free) |

```bash
# To use Ollama local model:
OLLAMA_MODELS=/path/to/models OLLAMA_ORIGINS="*" ollama serve

# Pull recommended model
ollama pull qwen3:14b-q8_0
```

## 🎮 How to "Play"

This isn't a traditional game — it's a **living simulation**. You observe and occasionally interact:

1. **Watch** — NPCs autonomously decide what to do based on their AI reasoning
2. **Click NPCs** — View their status, thoughts, health, and current task
3. **Talk** — Click an NPC to start a conversation (your words affect their mood and decisions)
4. **Monitor Resources** — The top bar shows wood, food, power, materials in real-time
5. **Survive 4 Days** — Can your town make it through the -60°C blizzard?

### Tips
- Pay attention to the **Day 3 Readiness Check** — it tells you if you're prepared for Day 4
- If an NPC's health drops below 30 with no food and no energy, they enter **Dying State**
- Dr. Su can save dying NPCs — but only if she gets there in time
- The second furnace is critical for Day 4 — make sure someone is building it by Day 2

## 🔧 Development

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript + HTML5 Canvas (zero dependencies)
- **AI Engine**: LLM API (Ollama local / OpenAI-compatible cloud)
- **Server**: Node.js static file server (optional, for LLM proxy)
- **Maps**: Procedurally generated via Canvas API (no Tiled/tilemap)
- **Pathfinding**: A* algorithm with BFS target correction

### Design Principles
1. **Every task must have verifiable game effects** — no fake busywork
2. **Resource balance: design consumption first, then derive gathering rates**
3. **Health→Death chain must have explicit numerical progression**
4. **LLM is an unreliable dependency** — always have fallback, retry, and circuit breaker
5. **Debug observability is core infrastructure** — if you can't see it in debug panel, it doesn't exist
